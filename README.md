# Description

This is a repository to host my Git Pages website, with the goal of housiing my online projects and guides so that they can easily and reliably be published onto the web. It is also something of a playground for me to experiment a little with frontend development. Do excuse the terrible work done on the website. I don't know what I'm doing half the time. Please note that I have enabled Google Adsense to place a couple banner ads. There's gonne be two of them at most ever, just for me to make pocket change every month.

# General Features

This website is built with BootStrap 4, iconography with Font Awesome, and general architecture using basic HTML/CSS. Web analytics are done using Clicky. This is just for me to gauge interest, so if you don't trackers, feel free to block them. Otherwise, custom JS scripting is fairly minimal as there has not been much need for interactbility.
This website primarily contains content about SimplePlanes game mechanics. This is currently the only website that serves Funky Trees documentation. I currently offer a full page of tutorial on Funky Trees, another page on basic PID tuning, and some embeds with Repl hosted scripts for some helpful scripts.
