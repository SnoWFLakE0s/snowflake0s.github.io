                      First implemented in game version 1.9, Funky Trees is a special subset of XML editing/modding in SimplePlanes that specifically deals with the <code>group</code>, <code>activationGroup</code>, and <code>input</code> attributes of parts. By nature, Funky Trees is a special subfield of what's known as XML editing/modding in SimplePlanes. Difficulty with basic XML editing may prove detrimental to learning the Funky Trees system.

                	<p>
                		  To be more specific, when a user does things in SimplePlanes, like controlling an aircraft by moving the joystick or pressing the keyboard, essentially what's being done is that the user is sending a signal to the various functional components on the craft to move it as the user intends it to. Funky Trees expands the options here and allows for much more complex programming of the inputs to allow for very special input programming to allow creation of incredibly powerful and useful parts.
                	</p>
                	<p>
                	    For example, users have created parts that carry out complex actions that weren't possible before 1.9, such as <a href="https://www.simpleplanes.com/a/9sn0hS/">functional all-altitude bombsights</a>, <a href="https://www.simpleplanes.com/a/m186lK/">the first functionally complete chronographs</a>, and <a href="https://www.simpleplanes.com/a/CRzBNA/">automatic flight control systems</a>. As it stands, Funky Trees can be considered a very specifically designed programming language- it fufills <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">the definition of one.</a>

            			Funky Trees isn't some entirely new field of study, but given the broad expanse of what it covers, the following concepts are recommended for full mastery of Funky Trees capability. These come in no particular order, there is no need for you to master all of them, but to use <i>everything</i> in Funky Trees, you must know all of these concepts.

            			Not unlike other conventional programming languages, Funky Trees utilizes a system of inputs and outputs. It takes various <code>inputs</code>, processes them, and relays an <code>output</code> that is then taken by the part (whatever "part" you're putting FT inputs into) to result in some kind of of behavior by the part.
            		</p>
            		<p>
            		    By the same token, Funky Trees follows a set of predefined rules to make the system work. This is commonly known as "syntax". There aren't a large number of rules in Funky Trees- they can be generalized to the following:
            		</p>
            		<ul>
            		    <li><strong>Spelling matters</strong>, including spacing (see "semantics")</li>
            		    <li><strong>Capitalization matters:</strong> <code>Hello</code> and <code>hello</code> are two very different things</li>
            		    <li>Mathematical operations in Funky Trees follows <strong>standard order of operations</strong> (see "operators")</li>
            		    <li><strong>One small error leads to the entire expression not evaluating / evaluating incorrectly.</strong> Often this may be the case for complicated input expressions that yield errors.</li>
            		</ul>
            		<p>
            		    Another common idea from programming comes into play in Funky Trees- when a certain, specifc order of symbols are grouped together in a very specifc way, they can hold meaning in the eyes of the system. This is commonly known as "semantics". For example, in the eyes of Funky Trees, the expression <code>altitude</code> has no meaning to the system. However, the expression <code>Altitude</code> has a very specifc value and meaning to the system, and the expression will evaluate accordingly. If these "very specifc combinations of symbols" are likened to functional "elements", it is possible to categorize these elements into to one of three categories. They are:
            		</p>
            				<ol>
            					<li>Variables</li>
            					<li>Functions</li>
            					<li>Operators</li>
            				</ol>
            		<p>
            			The following sections elaborate on these three categories in great detail, just after the data types section.

            			To give an <code>input</code> to the part, you probably need some sort of data to work with, right? Since version 1.9.2, Funky Trees was revamped to have data type organization.
            			To explain, all usable data types in Funky Trees have now been organized into one of three categories- numbers, booleans, and strings. Here’s a rundown:
            		</p>
            				<ul>
            					<li>Numbers are numbers including floats (e.g. 1, 1314, 12.0003, 0.334, etc).</li>
            					<li>Booleans are very useful for logic. They are either true, or false. If you use them in conjunction with other data types, true or false can output the numbers 1 or -1 respectively. Previously, before 1.9.2, booleans were inconsistent, this now has been fixed to be much more predictable.</li>
            					<li>Strings are basically lines of text. They must be enclosed in quotations (“” marks) (e.g. "Text").</li>
            				</ul>
            		<p>
            			Hopefully, this made sense. If you're new to computer science, these terms may sound completely alien to you- but don't worry, it'll make sense in due time (this is the only reason why programming experience comes in handy, to help orient yourself quicker).

                			I first want to make sure that you understand what variables are in Funky Trees. Simply put, <b>variables</b> are special words that have a special value in Funky Trees. They <i>contain</i> data. The data type organization, in other words, is a way of organizing these variables (among other things) into different types.

                      <hr>
                        <p>
                          There are largely two different kinds of variables available to you in Funky Trees. The first are the "original" variety and the ones that have been here since the beginning of Funky Trees: "input variables". These variables contain various kinds of data that are related to the current state of the game, including (but not limited to) things like the speed of the current aircraft, the time elapsed since the beginning of the sandbox session, and so on and so forth. These are given to you by default, and can be accessed at any time without any other procedures aside from just writing them in your code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The following is a list of all input variables. It most certainly looks quite daunting, but don't panic: this is simply for reference.

                              Booleans were previously inconsistent in Funky Trees due to a couple errors. The system has been revamped completely, removing the root source of that error. Now, if you only use boolean statements independent of other data types, you will get the value <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If you use booleans in conjunction with the number data type, they will automatically convert to 1 or -1 (true or false respectively). That also means, in the table down below, all the booleans can also be considered to have a possible range of values of -1 or 1.
                              <b>TL;DR: All boolean data type variables return either true or false, or 1 or -1 depending on its usage. This makes these logically consistent. </b>
                              The following is a list of all number type variables and their possible values.

                              Simply put, strings are just lines of text, like "text". The number of actual strings datatype <b>variables</b> is technically only one as of the time of writing. However, whatever you make your string- be it “this string” or “that string”- are all valid strings. Strings don't really have a large variety of applications right now, but they can be useful.

                      <hr>
                      <p>
                        Now for the second type of variables available to you in Funky Trees--custom variables. A recent addition to the growing abilities of Funky Trees, custom variables were introduced in version 1.11 of SimplePlanes. Custom variables are special because you can create them (and thus are not available by default). There are two sub-categories of custom variables, the first and most common kind being setter variables, and the second and less-used variety being part variables.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Variables allow for some powerful methods of Funky Trees coding not previously available, and also greatly simplifies certain tasks that lead to long, complicated, and unreadable Funky Trees code prior to their introduction. <i>However, you <b>do not need to use them for basic snippets of Funky Trees code!</b></i> Do not make things more complex than they need to be--this is a common mistake for beginning programmers. That being said, let's begin with setter variables.
                      </p>
                      <ol style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li>
                          <div id="settervariables">
                            <h5>1. Setter variables</h5>

                            <p>
                              Setter variables are the kind of variables you will use the most. First, to access these and begin writing into them, you must open the "variable setters" menu next to the "start sandbox" menu, indicated by an icon that looks like an "x": <img src="/funkyguide/images/variablesetters.png" alt="variablesettermenu" height="18em">
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Once opened, you will see the "Variable Setters" window open:
                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <img src="/funkyguide/images/settermenu.png" alt="settermenu" height="250em">
                            <hr>
                            <p>
                              You can then press "Add Variable" to create a new "variable setter".
                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <img src="/funkyguide/images/newvariable.png" alt="newvariable" height="250em">
                            <hr>
                            <p>
                              This creates a new "variable setter", the namesake of which comes from the fact that SimplePlanes will use this in order to constantly set the custom variable with the name in the "Variable Name" field with the Funky Trees code in the "Expression" field. Do precisely that, simply writing any custom variable name (that is not already reserved by the Input Variables). For example, we'll use <kbd>x</kbd> as our variable name, with the expression <kbd>Throttle</kbd> as our value. If you now use the variable <kbd>x</kbd> in any of your code, it will hold the value <kbd>Throttle</kbd>. This can be extrapolated to any reasonable extent, which is great when you have large, repeating sections of your code, say for example, an expression that calculates the number of shots you have fired with your cannon. This can make your Funky Trees code more compact, modular and easily readable and modifiable without having to worry that you misspelled a part of that long repeating section. If you want to delete your variable, simply press the <img src="/funkyguide/images/delete.png" alt="delete" height="16em"> button at any time to remove it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Setter variables also have additional attributes accessible by the small dropdown button <img src="/funkyguide/images/dropdown.png" alt="dropdown" height="16em"> to the left of the delete button. This reveals some new options, named "Priority" and "Activator":

                              It is convinient to think of the variable setters as a "list". That is because SimplePlanes will calculate the value of variables in order from top to bottom as shown in your variable setters menu. You can change the order of that list by moving a setter up and down with those buttons in the dropdown menu. Now, if you have multiple variable setters with the same variable name, normally the last setter will determine the final value of the variable. You may test this by creating two setters for a variable <kbd>x</kbd>, the first with any value, and second with value <kbd>0</kbd>. If you check the value of the variable in the sandbox, you will find that <kbd>x</kbd> always evaluates to 0. Now, the <b>priority</b> of a variable can alter this behavior by determining which "gets the final say" in the determination of the final value of a variable. The priority is by default 0, but can be set to any whole number (even negative numbers). However, it is good practice to just use positive integers. A setter with <i>higher postive priority</i> will determine the final value of the variable, meaning that in the previous example, if you set your first setter with priority <kbd>1</kbd> and the second left at 0, the variable <kbd>x</kbd> will no longer evaluate to 0 but instead whichever value you set it to.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Activators are what they sound like--they either enable or disable the functioning of the its respective variable setter. An activator must be a boolean value (refer to the relevant section for information). If the value is "true", the variable setter will function normally. If the activator is "false" however, the variable setter will not function: <b>the variable's value will no longer be changed by that variable setter</b>. This is an important distinction from "the variable is disabled", because once created the variable always exists and holds a value. You can still use the variable in your code, but the if the setter is disabled it will no longer update that variable's value. A common application for this can be to store values in memory. As a quick note, if a variable is created but is disabled by default, it will by default have value 0. There is no "null" value for variables.

                              What makes these setter variables so powerful is that when their nature of being evalulated in steps, the priority feature, and activators are combined, they can do incredibly useful logical processing, such as even program games like <a href="https://www.simpleplanes.com/a/GhY3Qy/Snek-Game">Snake</a> or <a href="https://www.simpleplanes.com/a/20Dqur/TETRIS">Tetris</a>.

                              Part variables are arguably less useful, but can prove crucial when you have various components of your craft doing different things, or want special kinds of data available to you. You can access them by first selecting a part in the editor, pressing the edit button <img src="/funkyguide/images/edit.png" alt="edit" height="16em">, then the part variables button <img src="/funkyguide/images/variablesetters.png" alt="variablebutton" height="16em">, which looks identical to its normal setter counterpart. Open it, and you will see the following kind of menu appear: 
                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <img src="/funkyguide/images/partvariables.png" alt="partvariablesmenu" height="250em">
                            <hr>
                            <p>
                              The labels indicate what kind of data that setter represents, but the method for using these setters are identical to the normal ones described earlier. For example, for the cockpit part, if you use the setter for "Altitude" and call it <kbd>x</kbd>, <kbd>x</kbd> will now hold the value of that cockpit part's altitude. These also have the same priority and activator options like their normal brethren. Now, not all kinds of parts have part variables, and each type of part typically has different types of data accessible. As a quick note, from empirical testing, it has been found that without any priority or activator modifications, any part variables are evaluted last, after your normal setters are finished calculating.

                			Now is the time to jog your brain for actual school math: remember functions? All that f(x) and g(x) and stuff? Well, now it's in SimplePlanes, and you can use it to do cool stuff. Functions are special objects that take in <code>inputs</code> and return an <code>output</code>, each depending on what the function does. Functions, in Funky Trees, are designed like so:
                		</p>
                		    <div class="text-center"><p>function(input)</p></div>
                		<p>
                		    Functions are defined to the system by the function name- in the example, the word <code>'function'</code>. Functions also have one more crucial attribute: they also have an <code>'input'</code> within the parentheses following the function name. Some functions take more than one input, for example, the <code>clamp</code> function takes inputs in the form of <code>clamp(x, a, b)</code>. Functions can only take specific datatypes as inputs (which is why I previously covered the data types)- there are functions that only accept <code>string</code>-type data as inputs, like the <code>ammo</code> function. The following is a list of all available functions as of game version 1.9.205. The following is simply for reference.

                		                    Number based functions are the most conceptually simple. It takes inputs that would be classified under the ‘number’ data type, and outputs a ‘number’ data type. However, if you recall Section 2A, it was mentioned that booleans can be converted to a number of 1 or -1 (true or false)- this means that number based functions <em>can</em> take boolean inputs, but note that the number function is taking not the boolean themselves as input, but only the number-converted boolean. A number function will not take a string input, like the string <code>"thisstring"</code>. They will also only ouput a number, i.e. a number function might take the value 1 and output 0.2.

                		                    These functions were added in game version 1.9.2. These are functions that measure things with respect to time. In particular, the rate and sum functions are the FT equivalent of derivatives (d/dx) and integrals (&#8747;dx), which enables the creation of far advanced inputs. These functions can be greatly useful but most things can be done without them, so do not fret- if your math is on the level to understand derivatives and integrals, then you don’t really need much explanation on what these will do. We're not working with variable expressions, so more of the academic calculus like the power rule is pretty much useless- you will really only be utilizing the practical application of them.

If a final value of 5 is desired, adding 4 to the current Roll value will yield 5. Therefore the expression <code>Roll + 4</code> would evaluate (result) in: <code>(+1) + (+4) == (+5)</code>. All of the math operators are used in similar fashion to the example illustrated.

                            <p>Logic operators are conceptually more abstract, as they rely on boolean logic instead of simple algebra. They always output a boolean value as the ouput- either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. There are three types of operators- comparison, boolean, and selection operators. Each is explained below. For some operators, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table">truth table</a> is also included for reference.</p>

                                    Comparison operators are very conceptually simple. They compare the two values on each side of the operator and output the result as a boolean. Comparison operators only take numbers as input (or number-converted booleans).

                                    For boolean operators, if the first argument of the operator is terminal, that is, it immediately dictates the output of the evaluation, it will not check the second argument at all. This applies for both the OR and AND operator.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    <b>Example</b>
                                    In <code>sum(Time) > 1 | sum(2*Time) > 1</code>, while <code>sum(Time) > 1</code>, <code>sum(2*Time)</code> will not update (i.e. not change, making it stay at 0 until the first condition is no longer true). If you need to use these operators in conjunction with update-sensitive time-based functions, try to use boolean algebra instead, that is, try to figure a numerical comparison method instead of logic-based.

                    The first three sections of this guide provides apt commentary / explanation on the theoretical aspect of Funky Trees. However, the practical aspect of designing and programming a Funky Trees input has yet to be discussed; as such, this section will discuss practical implementation of Funky Trees inputs. Specifcally, this section deals with actual <i>writing</i> of inputs, as many struggle with this. As with any other XML editing, there are two approaches to editing the XML file of a creation. One is using inbuilt Overload XML editor (cross-platform) or using a text editor to directly edit XML files. Either approach allows for the same kind of editing, although for mass edits a search-replace function that comes inbuilt with most text editors may be far more preferable.

                <h4>Compatability</h4>
                <p>
                    Funky Trees inputs are compatible with three types of attributes within XML editing: the <code>input</code> attribute within the <code>inputController</code> class of attributes, and the <code>activationGroup</code> and <code>group</code> attributes for certain parts. The behavior of Funky Trees in each of these is different, which warrants an explanation.
                </p>

                            <hr>
                                <p>
                                    The <code>input</code> attribute is usually the primary application of Funky Trees. Most gizmo-type parts and propulsion-type parts contain an <code>inputController</code> class of attributes that contains the <code>input</code> attribute. The following image is an example of an <code>input</code> attribute Overload window.
                                </p>

                                    Note the highlighted sections. The under the <code>inputController</code> class, the <code>input</code> attribute is visible, with the value of the <code>input</code> attribute on the side. In the example, the input is <code>Throttle</code>. A Funky Trees expression can be entered here. The behavior of parts is unique for each part- an input will simply determine the degree to which an part responds. It is the fine-tuning and programming of these "degree of response" that Funky Trees is concerned with, producing very useful and special behavior.

                                    The <code>activationGroup</code> attributes are usually of lesser importance for Funky Trees (but can prove to be useful). Practially all parts, aside from structural parts like fuselage blocks, contain an <code>activationGroup</code> attribute, typcially contained under <code>inputController</code> classes or part-specifc classes. The following image is an example of an <code>activationGroup</code> attribute Overload window.

                                    Note the highlighted sections. For the example, under the <code>Magnet</code> class (a part-specifc class), the <code>activationGroup</code> attribute is visible, with the value of the <code>activationGroup</code> attribute on the side. In the example, the value is <code>1</code>. A Funky Trees expression can be entered here.

                                    The <code>group</code> attribute is practically the same as <code>activationGroup</code>, but only applies for certain types of types like detachers. The following image is an example of an <code>activationGroup</code> attribute Overload window.

                                    Note the highlighted sections.

                                    <strong>The difference in response to Funky Trees defines the difference between <code>input</code> attributes and <code>activationGroup</code> / <code>group</code> attributes.</strong> For <code>input</code> attributes, the behavior of parts simply depends on the numerical value of the input. However, <b>for <code>activationGroup</code> and <code>group</code> attributes, the behavior is a boolean (<code>true / false</code>, <code>on / off</code>), defined by the value of the FT expression being larger than 0.</b> For example, for a detacher with some FT expression, the detacher will activate / fire the moment the FT expression in it returns a value larger than 0. For this reason, it may be largely preferable to have FT expressions for the <code>activationGroup</code> and <code>group</code> attributes be based on booleans instead of mathematical systems.

                    Sections 1 to 4 cover practically all that can be taught in the realm of the Funky Trees system. The actual formulation of actual Funky Trees expressions largely depend on the creator's own ability to manipulate these features included in the Funky Trees package- studying expressions by other creators may help apply the same style of patterns to one's own. Additionally, there also exist standardized/generalized FT expression for specifc purposes, which may be helpful to the common creator. A full index of commonly used general Funky Trees expressions can be found in the <a href="/expressionscatalog.html">commonly used FT expressions</a> page (currently under construction). This final fifth section covers other tools that can assist in forming FT programs.

                                Whilst creating FT expressions, especially for longer, more complicated expressions, it may be desirable to be able to obtain an live readout of the actual values of expressions. Using the inbuilt game console, accessed using the <kbd>`</kbd> key on PC platforms and three finger taps on mobile platforms, a debugger console is available to debugging FT expressions. Type the following command into the console:
                            </p>
                            <kbd>DebugExpression "expression"</kbd>
                            <p>
                                Where <strong><kbd>expression</kbd> is the FT expression you are attempting to debug.</strong> This can be used with any FT expression- <strong>however, for FT expressions that contain quotation marks (<kbd>""</kbd>) (for string values), the quotation marks inside the FT expression must be replaced with sharp marks (<kbd>##</kbd>).</strong> This is to avoid issues with confusing the console.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once the <kbd>DebugExpression</kbd> command is used, a small window will appear on the top left corner of the screen displaying your entered expression, and also the value of the expression aside a colon mark <kbd>:</kbd>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To clear the debugger console, enter the command <kbd>ClearDebugExpressions</kbd> into the console.

                              When writing Funky Trees code, you may find that it is quite difficult to actually make sense of what you're writing, especially in terms of code structure and trying to figure out if you have the right number of parentheses in the expression. Sometimes you want to stop writing the same variable name over and over again. Or you just might want a good text editor, especially for programming.

                              <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> is a great open source software that does everything you really need for funky trees. It has a parentheses highlighting function that helps you figure out pairings, word autofill for variables that you are repeatedly using, and a lot more that can help you do funky trees easier. Of course, Notepad or TextEdit is fine, but Atom is a great software that just makes life easier. You can also custom-code extensions that do things for you.
